# IP subnetting calcultor

### Introduction
The aim of this project was to combine networking knowledge of subnetting and create a one size-fits all subnetting calculator.
The ip subnet calculator, functinos by taking in a network's ip, with host bits off, and it's assocaited subnet mask in CIDR notation.
The calculator outputs: subnet blocks, subnet mask representation in binary, broadcast address, valid host range and more.
This utilitiy will also go through iterations. Intial iteration was created to set the backbone of the project, all whilst focusing on creating maintanable code. 
Hence the use of classes, boilerplate code and lots of commenting.

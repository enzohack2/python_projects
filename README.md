# Python Projects

### Introduction 
A range of projects, small to large, that I've developed using [python](https://www.python.org/); a high level, object-oriented programming langauge.
Projects range from being small pet projects to scripts that have been deployed at my place of work.
Take for example the EPOD project; which leverages web-scraping to adminsiter user accounts within the EPOD portal.
